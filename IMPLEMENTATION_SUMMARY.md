## Algorithm Implementation Details

### Step 1: Model Architecture (‚úÖ Complete)

Implemented a 20-layer MLP as `nn.Sequential` where each layer is a separate module:
- Each layer: `f_‚Ñì(z_{‚Ñì-1}; x_‚Ñì) = activation(W @ z_{‚Ñì-1} + b)`
- Smooth activations: tanh, sigmoid, softplus
- Activation tracking during forward pass
- Final layer fuses output and loss computation

### Step 2: Mixed Partial Derivatives (‚úÖ Complete)

Implemented `compute_layer_derivatives()` that computes all required derivatives:
- **First-order**: `‚àá_x f_‚Ñì`, `‚àá_z f_‚Ñì`
- **Second-order**: `‚àá_{xx} f_‚Ñì`, `‚àá_{zx} f_‚Ñì`, `‚àá_{xz} f_‚Ñì`, `‚àá_{zz} f_‚Ñì`
- Uses PyTorch autograd with `create_graph=True`
- Handles both intermediate and loss layers
- Properly averages over batch dimension

### Step 3: Matrix Structures (‚úÖ Complete)

Implemented block-structured matrices:
- **M**: Block bi-diagonal (identity on diagonal, `-‚àá_z f_{‚Ñì+1}` on lower)
  - Efficient solver using back-substitution
  - Equivalent to backpropagation
- **P**: Downshifting matrix
  - Implemented as dense matrix
- **D_D, D_M**: Block-diagonal with Kronecker products
  - `I ‚äó b_‚Ñì` structure
- **D_x, D_{xx}, D_{zx}, D_{xz}, D_{zz}**: Block-diagonal derivative matrices

Efficient representations:
- Block-diagonal: Lists of blocks
- Block bi-diagonal: Two lists (diagonal + lower diagonal)
- Avoid dense matrix formation where possible

### Step 4: Hessian-Inverse-Vector Product (‚úÖ Complete)

Implemented full 4-step algorithm from Section 5.1 (lines 670-741):

**Step 1**: Compute `g' = [D_x; I] g`
- Simple block-diagonal matrix-vector product
- Cost: O(Lap)

**Step 2**: Compute `Q^{-1}` and form `A`
- Build Q blocks: `Q11, Q12, Q21, Q22`
- Use partitioned inverse formula
- Compute Schur complement: `S = Q11 - Q12 Q22^{-1} Q21`
- Form `A = MÃÇ Q^{-1} MÃÇ^T + [[D_x D_x^T, D_x], [D_x^T, I]]`
- Cost: O(12L max(a,p)¬≥)

**Step 3**: Apply `A^{-1}` using LDL^T decomposition
- Extract blocks `A11, A12, A22`
- Compute `A22^{-1}` and Schur complement
- Apply block LDL^T factorization
- Cost: O(15L max(a,p)¬≥)

**Step 4**: Compute `y = g - [D_x; I]^T g''`
- Final matrix-vector product
- Cost: O(Lp)

**Total cost**: O(16L max(a,p)¬≥) - linear in L!

### Step 5: Training Loop (‚úÖ Complete)

  1. Standard gradient descent (baseline)
  2. Hessian-preconditioned gradient descent
