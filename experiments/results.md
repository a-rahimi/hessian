# Newton experiment results

One block per completed experiment, appended in completion order. The Interpreter agent writes each block by parsing `experiments/runs/<id>/stdout.log` and comparing against all earlier blocks in this file.

**Schema per block:** YAML frontmatter (id, run_name, commit_hash, descent_score, ranks among prior runs, hypothesis_supported boolean) followed by a one-paragraph narrative interpretation.

**Ranking metric:** `probe_loss` at the final step (lower = better). Secondary: descent slope = (probe_loss[14] - probe_loss[0]) / 14.

Heavy damping (epsilon=100) did produce overall descent on probe_loss, from 2.7178 down to 2.3839, with a clean negative slope of about -0.0137 over the final five steps and zero LM rejections, so the scaled-SGD-like prediction was directionally right. The descent was not monotonic, though, because probe_loss rose at steps 3 and 8 and the trajectory wobbled by roughly 0.07 to 0.10 between adjacent steps, which is large relative to the total descent. That bumpiness, together with a final value of 2.38 rather than the predicted 2.25, suggests two things. First, the per-batch Hessian and gradient mismatch is meaningful even with strong damping because we evaluate on a held-out probe while stepping on minibatch directions, so single-step noise dominates the signal. Second, with epsilon this large the effective step is essentially gradient descent with lr near 1/100 on the well-conditioned directions, which is too small to clear the random-guess plateau at 2.30 in only 15 steps. The plateau-approach shape in the last five steps, where the slope flattens and |g| drops from about 6 to about 1.2, hints that we are stalling near a flat region rather than still meaningfully descending. The next axis worth probing is whether the bumpiness comes from batch-to-batch disagreement, which is testable by reusing batches, or from the damping level itself being mistuned, which is testable by sweeping epsilon downward toward the natural Hessian scale.
