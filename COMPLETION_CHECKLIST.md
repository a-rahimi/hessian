- [ ] User needs to verify numerical correctness

## What User Needs to Do

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run tests to verify**:
   ```bash
   python3 test_hessian.py
   ```
   Should show: `✓ Test PASSED` for all tests

3. **Try simple example**:
   ```bash
   python3 simple_example.py
   ```
   Trains on CIFAR-10, should complete in ~5-10 min

4. **Optional: Train on ImageNet**:
   ```bash
   python3 train_imagenet.py --data-dir /path/to/imagenet --use-hessian
   ```
