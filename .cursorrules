# Cursor Rules for Hessian Project

## Python Environment
Always use the virtual environment located at `/Users/ali/hessian/.venv` when running Python code.

- Use the Python interpreter directly: `/Users/ali/hessian/.venv/bin/python`
- Or activate first: `source /Users/ali/hessian/.venv/bin/activate`

## Running Python Commands
When executing Python scripts, tests, or any Python code in this project, always use the virtual environment to ensure consistent dependencies and package versions.

## Code Generation Guidelines
* Comments: Avoid comments that just paraphrase the code that follows. Instead, have the comment say things that are not obvious from
  a cursory reading of the code.

* Tests: Test files don't need a main driver. They'll always be called through
  pytest. They'll never be called as standalone programs.
