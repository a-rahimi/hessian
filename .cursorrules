# Cursor Rules for Hessian Project

## Python Environment
Always use the virtual environment located at `/Users/ali/hessian/.venv` when running Python code.

- Use the Python interpreter directly: `/Users/ali/hessian/.venv/bin/python`
- Or activate first: `source /Users/ali/hessian/.venv/bin/activate`

## Running Python Commands
When executing Python scripts, tests, or any Python code in this project, always use the virtual environment to ensure consistent dependencies and package versions.

## Code Generation Guidelines

* Comments: Comments that preceed a code block andexplain several lines of code
  are instructive and should be kept. But avoid comments that literally repeat in Englishthe
  code that follows. We comments that say things that are not obvious from a cursory reading of the code.
  For example, these are all redundant comments:

	```
	# Assign b to a
	a = b
	# Call a's callback.
	a.call_callback()
	```

  The following comments are useful because theyadd some context:
	```
	# Save b. We're going to modify it and would like to keep it around.
	a = b
	# The above subtly changes the state of a. Notify its clients of that
	# change.
	a.call_callback()
	```

* Tests: Test files don't need a main driver. They'll always be called through
  pytest. They'll never be called as standalone programs.
