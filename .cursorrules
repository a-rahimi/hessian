# Cursor Rules for Hessian Project

## Python Environment
Always use the virtual environment located at `/Users/ali/hessian/.venv` when running Python code.

- Use the Python interpreter directly: `/Users/ali/hessian/.venv/bin/python`
- Or activate first: `source /Users/ali/hessian/.venv/bin/activate`

## Running Python Commands
When executing Python scripts, tests, or any Python code in this project, always use the virtual environment to ensure consistent dependencies and package versions.
